# Transactions

A simple application that shows the top 20 transactions from an API list.

## Local

This application can be run locally by following these steps:

- npm i
- npm run dev

## Note

You will need npm installed on your machine. The transactions come from a hosted site and are built in statically. If that site has issues then you may see an error message instead of the transactions.
